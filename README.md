# The Melting Pot

Hello üëã

Welcome to my imaginary restaurant page! üçΩ

This is a single page website, a mockup created for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
It consists of a Home page, a Menu page and a Contact page. All page content is created dynamically using `JavaScript`. Except for the `link`s and `script`s, nothing is hard-coded to the `HTML`.

## Technologies Used

- `npm`
- `webpack`
  - `style-loader`
  - `css-loader`

## Installation

The `dist/` folder has the production files that are currently hosted on the Github Pages.

If you would like to make changes and build from the source files, the `package.json` file contains the dependencies.

- You should be able to run `npm install` or `npm install --dev` to automatically install the dependencies.
- You can then
  - run `npm run watch` or `npx webpack --watch` to let webpack _constantly_ monitor a change in `src/` and build automatically
  - or `npm run build` to build whenever.
