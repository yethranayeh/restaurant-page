# The Melting Pot

Hello üëã

Welcome to my imaginary restaurant page! üçΩ

This is a single page website, a mockup created for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
It consists of a Home page, a Menu page and a Contact page. All page content is created dynamically using `JavaScript`, except for the `link`s and `script`s, nothing is hard-coded to the `HTML`.

## Technologies Used

- `npm`
- `webpack`
  - `style-loader`
  - `css-loader`

## Issues
1. Mobile based permanent hover states for menu cards seems to have been broken in production. The expected behavior was to have meal description always visible instead of hover-only when using mobile. Currently mobile users will be unable to see meal descriptions, only their pictures.
